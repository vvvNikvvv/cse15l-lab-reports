*Baseline "Done Quick" Challenge*

*Step-by-Step*

**Step 1: Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account**

*Keys pressed: ```<c><d><space><.><.>``` (cd out of Lab7/)
               ```<r><m><space><-><r><f><space><l><tab><enter>```
               Now remove the repository from your gitHub account by selecting the
               repository, going to settings, and scrolling down to remove option.
               You will need your password for this, so be prepared.

*For this step I used the cd .. to exit out of the lab7/ directory and proceeded to remove the directory
by using the rm -rf lab7/ command. I also explained how to remove the repository from the Github site
and included an additinoal screenshot.*
