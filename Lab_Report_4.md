 **Week 8: Lab Report 4**

*Baseline "Done Quick" Challenge*

*Step-by-Step*

---

**Step 1: Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account**

*Keys pressed: ```<c><d><space><.><.>``` (cd out of Lab7/)
               ```<r><m><space><-><r><f><space><l><tab><enter>```
               Now remove the repository from your gitHub account by selecting the
               repository, going to settings, and scrolling down to remove option.
               You will need your password for this, so be prepared.

Now go to your GitHub account, access the lab7/ file your forked, then proceed to click on *settings* and scroll down
until you see the *Delete this Repository* and click it. It will ask you to type your username followed by the name of 
the repository you are trying delete, in this case it will be *yourUsername*/lab7/.

*For this step I used the cd .. to exit out of the lab7/ directory and proceeded to remove the directory
by using the rm -rf lab7/ command. I also explained how to remove the repository from the Github site
and included an additional screenshot. I had done other commands after completing the last step, so this was actually
faster than clicking up 15+ times. Now that the repository is deleted form both the GitHub account and the server, we 
setup from scratch!*

**Step 2: Forking the repository**

First, go to the provided link to fork the lab7/ repository and look to the top right corner and find the fork option
and press it.

After clicking, you will get a confirmation with allowance to give a custom description.

Now you have the repository forked and ready for use by any server!

**Step : The real deal Start the timer**

If you don't have a smartphone or smartwatch, google 'timer' for simple use of a stopwatch feature.
