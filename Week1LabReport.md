*How to log into a course-specific account on ieng6*

1) Setting up Visual Studio Code

(Note: If you do not wish to use a personal laptop, feel free to use the computers 
provided in the CS building which have VS Code.)

To begin, click this link: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and 
follow each instruction for your given operating system.

If correctly installed, you should be able to open the application and see a similar
window as below (Note: may not be look identical based on different systems)

(Note: disregard my 'Recent' files, yours will be empty.)

2) Remotely Connecting

Now we will connect remotely to a computer via our course-specific accounts we have activated.

For Windows users, you need to download **git** for Windows here : [git](https://gitforwindows.org/) to use ssh.

Mac users, you are able to access ssh from a new terminal in the VS Code window directly

Now we are all on the same footing, go to the toolbar and click 'Terminal' then select 'New Terminal',
it should look like this:

Terminal is highlighted red and the yellow error shows where you will be entering information.

Now, to use **ssh**, type in 'ssh' before your course-specific account, my account is **cs15lwi23ana@ieng6.ucsd.edu**.
Yours will be identical *except* for the letters after '23' ('ana' in my case), yours are specific to you.

You will then be prompted to enter your password and hit enter. You will not be able to see the password for security purposes, so type it calmly and correctly. It should look like this if successful:

Note: if you enter incorrectly more than 3 times, your connection will be lost. I know from experience!
This case will look something like this:
