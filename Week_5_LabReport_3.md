*Researching Commands*

**grep** : *global regular expression print*

As the acronymic name suggest, this command-line utility is used to search for a plian-text data for a
specified word or set of words which are called 'patterns'. 
The template for use is 
> **grep** *[options]* **'pattern'** *[files]*

- *grep -r*:


- *grep -l*: 


- *grep -i*:


- *grep -c*:
