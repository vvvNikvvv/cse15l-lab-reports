*Researching Commands*

**grep** : *global regular expression print*

As the acronymic name suggest, this command-line utility is used to search for a plian-text data for a
specified word or set of words which are called 'patterns'. 
The template for use is 
> **grep** *[options]* **'pattern'** *[files]*

I will be exploring a few of the *options* at our disposal with grep and demonstrate a few examples.

- *grep -r*: performs a recursive search through all the files for the pattern in a given directory.


- *grep -l*: displays the name(s) of the file(s) that contain the pattern.


- *grep -i*: prints the name of the file and sentence containing the **case-insensitive** pattern.


- *grep -c*: prints the count of the number of times the pattern appears in a given file.
